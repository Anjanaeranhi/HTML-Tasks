    A natural disaster is characterized by the abnormal intensity of a natural agent (flood, mudslide, 
    earthquake, avalanche, drought) when the usual measures to be taken to prevent this damage were not
     able to prevent their emergence or were not able to be taken. An interministerial order notices the 
     state of natural disaster. He allows the compensation of the damage directly caused to the insured
      goods, set up by the 13 July 1982 law, relative to the compensation of the victims of natural dis
      asters. A natural disaster is recorded only if it causes damage not covered by usual insurance po
      licies.Forest fires and damage related to wind are not the subject of natural disaster rulings be
      cause they are insurable in conformance with the basic guarantee. In that case, no order of natur
      al disaster is taken even if goods were destroyed.
